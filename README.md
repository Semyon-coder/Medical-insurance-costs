## Key Insights
Charges can be split into three categories:  
• Low (0 - 12 thousand): the majority of non-smokers  
• Medium (12 - 30 thousand): smokers with BMI ≤ 30 and the minority of non-smokers  
• High (30 - 50 thousand): smokers with BMI > 30  
  
Within each category, there is a positive relation between age and charges (the older the client is, the higher the charges).
